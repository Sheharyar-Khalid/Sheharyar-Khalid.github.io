## About Me

Hello! I'm Sheharyar Khalid, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Virginia (UVA), advised by [Prof. Wajih Ul Hassan](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hur7wv/) and [Prof. Kevin Skadron](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/). I am currently part of the [DART Lab](https://dartlab.org) My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). My research ambitiously intersects system security, intrusion detection, SIEM systems, and hardware-based acceleration, with a current focus on developing FPGA-based solutions for efficient log data matching. 

My current work aims at improving system performance benchmarks and also earned the Best Poster Award at the UVA CS Research Symposium in 2023. Additionally, I explore provenance graphs for system security monitoring, aiming to advance secure system monitoring technologies.

I am open to opportunities for collaboration and internships. Please feel free to contact me at fsr5wf@virginia.edu.
